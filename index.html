<h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize" > i want to visit in 2022 , summer holidays or winter holidays </h5>
<P class="text-muted text-left"> i want to visit london in 2022 , summer holidays or winter holidays as ,
   most probably in 2022 covid-19 would not be there and we could fly to other countries also , 
   i would also specifically like to go to london in my winter or summer holidays as its one of the best times to visit
    london and i wouldn't have to miss school for travelling to london and would have more time to explore ... 
    the main reason that i want to go to london is because of my brother whom lives there and studies in a university ,
     i would love to give him a visit and also i would love to visit my best friend , 
   who is shifting to london in a few days from today...keeping all these reasons aside london is a wonderful place in general 
   and whom wouldn't want to visit it , also it has been a dream of mine to visit london since i was a little kid... </P>

  <h4>healthy food</h4>
  <img src="https://online.ahu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Healthy-Food-Doesnt-Have-To-Be-Expensive.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
  <P class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Healthy food does not have merely one but numerous benefits. It helps us in various spheres of life. 
    Healthy food does not only impact our physical health but mental health too.

    When we intake healthy fruits and vegetables that are full of nutrients, 
    we reduce the chances of diseases. For instance, green vegetables help us to maintain strength and vigor. 
    In addition, certain healthy food items keep away long-term illnesses like diabetes and blood pressure.
    
    Similarly, obesity is the biggest problems our country is facing now.
     People are falling prey to obesity faster than expected. However, this can still be controlled. 
     Obese people usually indulge in a lot of junk food. The junk food contains sugar, salt fats and more which contribute to obesity.
      Healthy food can help you get rid of all this as it does not contain harmful things.
    
    In addition, healthy food also helps you save money. 
    It is much cheaper in comparison to junk food. Plus all that goes into the preparation of healthy food is also of low cost.
     Thus, you will be saving a great amount when you only consume healthy food. </P>

  <h4>unhealthy food </h4>
  <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod.tctmd.com/public/styles/header_image/public/2021-03/Eating%20More%20Ultraprocessed%20%E2%80%98Junk%E2%80%99%20Food%20Linked%20to%20Higher%20CVD%20Risk.jpeg?itok=zmNGCySB" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
  <P class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">junk food has no or very less nutritional value and 
    irrespective of the way they are marketed, they are not healthy to consume.

    Most of them are high in saturated fats and sugar components and also in excess of salts and lack any fiber.
    
    The only reason of their gaining popularity and increased trend of consumption is that they are ready to eat or easy to cook foods.
    
    
    People, of all age groups are moving towards junk food as it is hassle free and often ready to grab and eat. Soft drinks,
     chips, wafers, noodles, pizza, burgers, 
    French fries etc. are few examples from the vast variety of fast food available in the market. </P>
